# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
Human Activity Recognition is a crucial area of research with applications spanning surveillance, healthcare, smart homes, and sports analytics. Traditional HAR systems have predominantly relied on sensor-based or handcrafted feature extraction techniques, which often fail to generalize across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging Temporal Convolutional Networks for video-based HAR using the Kinetics-400 dataset and the UCI HAR dataset. Unlike recurrent neural networks or long short-term memory networks, TCNs provide superior temporal feature extraction with parallelization advantages, making them suitable for real-time activity recognition. We focus on classifying five anomalous and five normal activities, ensuring a balance between security-related and everyday actions. The dataset is preprocessed by extracting 16-frame sequences from videos, normalizing the frames, and feeding them into a TCN model trained from scratch. Our results demonstrate that TCN-based HAR achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to traditional RNN-based architectures. The proposed model can be integrated into surveillance systems for anomaly detection or human behaviour analysis in real-world environments.
